# Google Foobar Challenge 

One day, I was reading through a rabit hole of StackOverflow when suddenly I googled what a list comprehension on python looked like (I knew what it was but couldn't recall the syntax, we've all been there), on google, naturally. 

Suddenly, the screen opened up like:

Curious as I was, I hit I want to play which took me to a different screen

One thing led to another and I completed the first 3 challenges!

This repo contains the foobar challenge solutions for Lev1, Lev2 and Lev3 and more levels soon..
